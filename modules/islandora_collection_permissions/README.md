# Islandora Collection Permissions

## Introduction

Exposes some sets of permissions for configuration at the collection level.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora Access Override](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_access_override)

## Installation

Install as usual, see
[this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for
further information.

## Troubleshooting/Issues

This module mirrors core permissions and does not create new conventions. Since
in the Islandora permissions set to access the UI to purge an object one must
have permissions to manage its properties the same is true with the permission
set provided by this module.

To account for the possiblity of membership in multiple collections, a breadth-
first traversal upwards from objects is used by default--in true tree
collection structures, this should act the same as a depth-first search. When
using the "Solr ancestor field" option, selected subtrees will be searched
depth-first (as the ancestor field does not track the node depth), falling back
to our breadth-first behaviour if a document does not happen to be present in
the Solr index.
